First Get the Data with Features and Labals (supervised learning)


(Math Concept involved stats and probability)

Then Read it using pandas data frame

and Plot it using matplot lib

set colors for label and then find pattern

and write it down in your word in a different place

and validate that your rule using like this by writing that rule as a logic

ex - : 

df = pd.read_csv("F:/Machine Learning Hands On/Hands on ML/student_details.csv")

# def rule(row):
#     return 1 if row["hours_studied"] > 4 and row["attendance"] > 65 else 0

# df["rule_pred"] = df.apply(rule, axis=1)

#     accuracy = (df["rule_pred"] == df["pass"]).mean()
# print("Rule Accuracy:", accuracy)

# print(df[["hours_studied","attendance"]].mean())
#  print(df[["hours_studied","attendance"]].std())


and then the if best accuracy have in the rule setup the model picking and the training process.

In Training Process

(Linear Algebra when comes to calcualte weights like matrix multiplications and for optimize using gradient decen that has calculus)

set a random weights and bias (like initially set 0) and learning rate set the loop and train the model 
using the exact picked up model formula and get the final weight and bias

weight means the what feature/features how much matters to the prediction outcome to prove my actual hand written rule


(Probability)

finally test the result with random data using already trained weights value/values and bias.
