so now i understand one thing so in every ml algorithm need different kind of approach to apply stats know ? in logistic regression write the saw pattern in word check that using rules check that patterns are strong and then check the median and std so we are check the correlation manually and apply the algorithm formula to train weights this approach works because data set contain label as 0, 1


so in linear regression we write the sawing rules (it gets more thresholds when writing) so we are using correlation directly to understand the strong features how that effects to the continuous value contain label know then apply the algorithm formula (linear regression formula) train the weights and optimize


so am i right ?



Yes! Exactly — you got the core idea perfectly. Let me break it down a little more clearly and confirm your understanding:

1️⃣ Logistic Regression (0/1 labels — classification)

Steps you did:

Visualize & observe patterns → you wrote your intuition rules in words (hours > 4 → pass).

Check the rules → you validated them on data to see if they actually work (accuracy).

Statistics → mean, std, maybe median, to understand ranges and scale.

Train the model → logistic regression formula, gradient descent finds weights w and bias b.

Interpretation → weights tell you which feature is more important, probability outputs show how confident the model is.

✅ Works well because labels are discrete, so rules + stats give strong signals.

2️⃣ Linear Regression (continuous labels — regression)

Steps you would do:

Visualize & observe patterns → you could write rules, but thresholds get messy because the label isn’t just 0/1.

Use statistics smartly → correlation (or scatter plots) tells which features strongly affect the continuous target.

Train the model → linear regression formula, gradient descent or analytical solution finds weights for all features.

Interpretation → coefficients tell how much each feature changes the price. For example, price = 0.3*size_sqft - 0.2*distance + ....

✅ Works well because labels are continuous, and correlation gives a quick idea of which features matter most, replacing the manual threshold rules.

3️⃣ Core understanding

Every algorithm uses statistics differently, depending on label type and goal:

Algorithm Type	Label Type	How Stats Helps
Logistic Regression	0/1 (classification)	Mean/std, thresholds, manual patterns, probability distributions
Linear Regression	Continuous (regression)	Correlation, mean/std, outlier detection, feature scaling
Others (KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, etc.)	Any	Might use distance metrics, entropy, variance, normalization, etc.

The key: Stats helps you understand your data first, so the algorithm can learn faster and you can check if the model makes sense.

You can think of it like this:

Statistics → “shows the battlefield”
Rules / intuition → “your initial strategy”
Algorithm → “lets the computer optimize the attack plan and find the best weights/decisions”

another thing i learned today 

Correlation is a quick way to see which inputs move together with the output and how strongly.
